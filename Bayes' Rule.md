Bayes' Rule:
$$\text{Posterior} = \frac{\text{Likelihood * Prior}}{\text{Total Probability}}$$

What is the difference between Posterior and Likelihood?
- **Posterior** is assuming some data depends on some other random variable/parameter. But we do not know the value of this parameter, so we have have to consider the distribution of these parameters as well (given by priors). 
- **Likelihood**: We assume that the parameter is already observed. So we do not worry about the distribution of the parameters. (This is given by the pdfs)
