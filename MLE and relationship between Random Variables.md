MLE provides a way to estimate parameters. If we have modeled the relationship between the two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, then that relationship can be modeled using parameters that are decided by MLE. 

MLE by itself does not ensure if there is even a relationship. 

There are other methods like hypothesis testing, causal inference techniques, or structural equation modeling to test that. 

However, if the co-efficient is **significantly** different from 0, and then a comment could be made about how one affects the other. Independence on the other hand is a stronger condition. 

**Conclusion**: Independence is a broader concept requiring zero correlation _and_ no higher-order associations, which a single test or a single model might not fully address.
