## Outcome Space
Say the **outcome space** is $\Omega$.
> **Question**: Outcome of what - an event or random variable?
> **Answer**: Neither. 
> The outcome space is of a **process** being considered. 
> For example, the process = *Flipping a coin*

## What is an **event**?
The outcome of an event is a subset of the outcome space. 
For example, event = Getting Heads (upon *flipping the coin* (process))

## What is a Random Variable?
It is a mathematical function that maps the whole outcome space to some real number: $X:\Omega \to \mathbb{R}$.

## Difference between Random Variables and Events:
Both are different concepts, while events outcome in a subset of all possible outcomes, random variables work with the whole outcome space. 

### But what value a random variable has, doesn't it depend on an event?
Yes. It does. We can use an event to describe how a value is assigned to the random variable $X$, but $X$ never becomes the event. It is still a random variable, that associates a probability to each outcome in the outcome space. 

### When we say that the outcome of an event is a subset of the sample space, how does it affect the RV if that event was used to describe the RV?
The effect on the random variable $X$ is that how values of the sample space $\Omega$ are mapped to some $\mathbb{R}$ gets changed. For example, the event `Tails` makes parts of the sample space being mapped to 0. 
$$X=1 \text{ when Outcome = `Heads'} $$
$$X=0 \text{ when Outcome = `Tails'} $$
`Event = Getting Heads`
