### Condition Number $\kappa(A)$:
- Ratio of the highest to the lowest singular number.
- If the ratio is high, it suggests that there are dimensions that do not provide a lot of information about the dimension. 
- Might also suggest linear dependence, or near-linear dependencies between columns or rows
- Matrix is close to becoming a [[Singular Matrices]]

### Ill-conditioned matrix
If a matrix is ill-conditioned, then $\kappa(A)$ is high. 

### Connection between ill-conditioned and invertible
- A matrix starts the journey of linear dependency with being ill-conditioned and then becomes invertible. 
- So an ill-conditioned matrix has **near-linear dependencies** between columns or rows.

### Why does an ill-condition cause high sensitivity to changes in input?
