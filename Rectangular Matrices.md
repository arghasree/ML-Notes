### Intuition:
- Rectangular matrices represent linear maps between vector spaces of different dimensions.
- Meaning you can go from one vector space to the other 
### Application:
1. Helps to solve systems of linear equations
### Properties:
1. [[Determinants]] are not defined.
2. Concept of [[Singular Matrices]] does not apply.
3. Does not have an adjoint.
4. Does not have an inverse.
5. Addition/Subtraction only possible if the orders of the 2 matrices are the same.
6. Multiplication only possible if the # of columns and rows match.
7. The product need not be rectangular
8. Cannot have eigenvectors or eigenvalues
